Reflection on Using GPT as  



This author came to the project with no experience in logic, coding or any of the required tools. GPT was instrumental in closing the knowledge gap and training in basic understanding of these disciplines in two weeks. 

For the original section defining the problem – it was not required and
for identifying data inputs and variables- not required
Used to provide input to original thinking on the ethics of automating animal feeding but didn’t add value to the critical thinking, only the sources to refer to.

For the identifying binary values, logic, Boolean expression, circuit concepts, modular sequences, the system, flowchart, word code it was crucial.

Copilot was useful in documentation; translating the plain English ideas into engineering language and valuable in training on testing methods, processes and methodologies.

Unless the student has prior knowledge of the underpinning logic and mathematical problem techniques AI will serve only as tutor. For students with prior understanding the LLM can co-produce the solution – however this relies on the student having the skills to verify the reliability of the contributions.
