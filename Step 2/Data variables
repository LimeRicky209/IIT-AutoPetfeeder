The following data inputs, outputs and considerations were identified:

1. Profile of pet and requirements
•	Type of pet: (e.g., dog, cat etc.)
•	Size, age of pet: (small, medium, large)
•	Feeding schedule: times per day, portion size
•	Food type: dry, wet food, pellets.
2. Feeder Mechanism & Operation
•	Dispensing method: gravity, motorised unit, rotary dispenser
•	Portion control: fixed or adjustable servings. 
•	Food storage capacity: volume needed between refills
•	Power source: battery, USB, electricity, solar power.
3. Control System
•	Automation level: timer-based, sensor-based, remote-controlled 
•	Sensors needed: scale/weight sensor, RFID sensor, food level detector
•	User interface: buttons, LED display. 
4. Manufacturing Assumptions and Cost Constraints
•	Food-safe container: ensure materials are safe for pet food
•	Manufacturing process: injection molding, 3D printing, assembly
•	Estimated materials cost and availability of components
•	Estimated maintenance ease and cost
6. Safety & Reliability Assumptions
•	Pet safety: avoid sharp edges, toxic materials, contamination
•	Food freshness: airtight storage, moisture control
•	Prevent jamming: mechanism to prevent food blockage
7. Maintenance & Usability
•	Ease of cleaning: removable parts, dishwasher-safe
•	Refill frequency: how often staff need to add food
•	Setup simplicity: easy use, minimal assembly
