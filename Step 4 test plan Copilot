# Automated Pet Feeder - Testing Framework & Code Refinement

## Current Logic Analysis & Improvements

### Issues Identified in Original Code:
1. **Variable naming inconsistency**: `feederull` vs `feederFull`
2. **Missing portion calculation logic** for size/age matching
3. **Incomplete refill detection logic**
4. **No error handling for sensor failures**
5. **Missing timeout mechanisms**
6. **No retry logic for failed operations**

## REFINED DECISION LOGIC

### Core Variables & States
```pseudocode
// Storage & Availability
feederFull = true/false          // Food container has sufficient food
foodStorageEmpty = true/false    // Food container is completely empty
foodAvailable = true/false       // Calculated: !foodStorageEmpty && feederFull

// Scheduling & Timing
scheduledFeedingTime = true/false
currentTime = timestamp
nextFeedingTime = timestamp

// Pet Identification & Portioning
petIdentified = true/false
petID = string/null
petSize = small/medium/large/null
petAge = young/adult/senior/null
requiredPortion = float (grams)

// Dispensing & Consumption
dispensingActive = true/false
foodDispensed = true/false
foodEaten = true/false
bowlWeight = float (grams)
initialBowlWeight = float
finalBowlWeight = float

// System Status
systemReady = true/false
sensorStatus = object {idScanner, weightSensor, dispenserMotor, ledLights}
errorCode = int/null
lastFeedingTime = timestamp
```

### Improved Decision Flow
```pseudocode
FUNCTION attemptFeeding():
    // Pre-checks
    IF !systemHealthCheck() THEN
        RETURN error("System sensors offline")
    
    // 1. Check Food Availability
    IF foodStorageEmpty OR !feederFull THEN
        triggerRefillAlert()
        RETURN error("Insufficient food supply")
    
    // 2. Verify Scheduled Time
    IF !scheduledFeedingTime THEN
        RETURN info("Not scheduled feeding time")
    
    // 3. Pet Identification & Portion Calculation
    petData = scanForPet(timeout=30seconds)
    IF !petData.identified THEN
        RETURN error("Pet not identified - access denied")
    
    requiredPortion = calculatePortion(petData.size, petData.age)
    IF requiredPortion > availableFood THEN
        triggerRefillAlert()
        RETURN error("Insufficient food for required portion")
    
    // 4. Dispense Food
    initialBowlWeight = readBowlWeight()
    dispensingResult = dispenseFood(requiredPortion)
    IF !dispensingResult.success THEN
        RETURN error("Dispensing mechanism failed")
    
    // 5. Monitor Consumption
    consumptionResult = monitorEating(timeout=600seconds)
    updateFeedingLog(petData.id, requiredPortion, consumptionResult)
    
    // 6. Post-feeding Checks
    checkFoodLevels()
    scheduleNextFeeding()
    
    RETURN success("Feeding cycle completed")
```
