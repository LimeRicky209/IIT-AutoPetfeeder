Animal Shelter Pet Feeding Problem Statement
The current manual approach is time-intensive, error-prone, and prevents staff from focusing on other essential animal care activities. Staff need a low-cost, automated system that ensures the following core requirements:
1.	The correct animal receives the right food type and portion size
2.	Feeding occurs at the appropriate times
3.	Comprehensive records are maintained
4.	Food inventory can be planned effectively
5.	Staff time is used efficiently
Automated Pet Feeder Functional Requirements
A.	Feeding Schedule: Define how often and how much food will be dispensed.
B.	Portion Control: Determine how to measure and dispense specific amounts of food.
C.	User Notifications: Implement alerts for low food levels or feeding status.
D.	Pet Safety: the feeder system is safe for pets.
